                Main article: Grand Prix racing history of Scuderia Ferrari
                Since its debut in 1950, Ferrari has become a byword for Formula One. 
                For many, Ferrari and Formula One racing have become inseparable, being 
                the only team to have competed in every season since the world championship began.

            <h2>Engine supply</h2>
            <p>
              Ferrari produces engines for its own Formula One cars and has supplied engines 
              to other teams. Ferrari has previously supplied engines to Minardi (1991), Scuderia 
              Italia (1992–1993), Sauber (1997–2005 with engines badged as Petronas, and 2010–2025), 
              Prost (2001, badged Acer), Red Bull Racing (2006), Spyker (2007), Scuderia Toro Rosso 
              (2007–2013, 2016), Force India (2008), and Marussia (2014–2015). When regulations 
              changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia, 
              Cosworth's only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, beginning in 
              2014. For the 2024 season, Ferrari supplies the Haas F1 Team and Sauber Motorsport.

            <h2>Relationship with governing body</h2>
            <p>
              Ferrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the 1950 British 
              Grand Prix, due to a dispute with the organisers over <i>"start money"</i>. In the 1960s, 
              Ferrari withdrew from several races in strike actions. In 1987, Ferrari considered 
              abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a 
              bargaining tool with the <b>Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)</b>, and 
              Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on 
              the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 
              engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a 
              car, the Ferrari 637, had already been constructed. In 2009, it had emerged that 
              Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.

            <h2>Team orders controversies</h2>
            <p>
              Team orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history. 
              At the 1982 <b>San Marino Grand Prix</b>, the two Ferraris were leading with Gilles 
              Villeneuve ahead of Didier Pironi. The team showed the slow sign to its drivers, 
              and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected 
              to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi 
              would follow; the latter did not and instead passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was 
              angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and, at one point, had 
              even refused to go onto the podium. This feud is often considered to have 
              been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, 
              the 1982 <b>Belgian Grand Prix</b>.

            <p>
              At the 2002 <b>Austrian Grand Prix</b>, after having started from pole position 
              and leading the first 70 laps, Rubens Barrichello was instructed to let 
              Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that proved to be 
              unpopular among many Formula One fans and the FIA, the sport's governing body. 
              Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as 
              McLaren's use of them at the 1997 <b>European Grand Prix</b> and at the 1998 <b>Australian 
              Grand Prix</b>, and <b>Jordan Grand Prix's</b> at the 1998 <b>Belgian Grand Prix</b>, team orders 
              in <b>Formula One were officially banned ahead of the 2003 season</b>.

              On lap 49 of the 2010 <b>German Grand Prix</b>, Fernando Alonso went past Felipe 
              Massa for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was 
              <i>"faster than him"</i>. This communication has widely been interpreted as a team 
              order from Ferrari. Alonso won the race, with Massa finishing second and 
              Sebastian Vettel taking the final place on the podium. Ferrari were 
              fined the maximum <b>penalty</b> available to the stewards, <b>$100,000</b>, for breach 
              of regulations and for <i>"bringing the sport into disrepute"</i> as per <i>"Article 151c' 
              of the International Sporting Code"</i>. Ferrari said they would not contest the 
              fine. The team were referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council, where they 
              upheld the stewards' view but did not take any further action. The 
              ban on team orders was subsequently lifted for the 2011 season.
