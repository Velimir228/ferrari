              He was widely known as <i>il Commendatore or il Drake</i>, a nickname given by British opponents

          <p>
            Le Mans is where Ferrari first came to global prominence. 
            Enzo Ferrari’s newly formed sports car company won the first post-war Le Mans, 
            in 1949. The scars of war were still evident. A section of the outfield was 
            still off limits for fear of land mines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The winning 166 MM was a small car by previous Le Mans-winning standards and 
            had the smallest capacity engine ever to win the race, just 2.0-litres. 
            Yet it was also the first V12 to win: previous winners typically had bigger 
            capacity four- and six-cylinder engines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 166 MM set the template for future Ferraris and for future Le Mans winners. 
            Its V12 would become a Ferrari signature. Its lightweight, aerodynamically 
            efficient body would influence every car that would subsequently taste victory.
